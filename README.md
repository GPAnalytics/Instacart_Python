# Instacart Python Analysis
A data analysis project using Python to analyze data from an online Grocery Store, Instacart.
## Objectives
As an analyst working with Instacart, an online grocery store operating through a mobile app, our primary objective is to conduct an initial data and exploratory analysis of their dataset. The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into customer behaviors and uncover meaningful patterns in their sales data. This, in turn, will enable us to provide valuable recommendations for better customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies.
